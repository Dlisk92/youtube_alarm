Control your volume mixer on Windows with Python 3

#Usage
simply give the hour u wish to be woken up at when prompted
you can also feed in what ever url you want to play(I have added a default option)((a playlist is probably better then a single video))
when the hour is reached this script sets system volume to max and goes to the url

#TODO
see if i can get an add free solution and add support for more granular alarms 9:55
maybe a gui for fun
